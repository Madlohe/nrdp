# Overview

NRDP (**N**agios **R**emote **D**ata **P**rocessor) is a simple, PHP-based passive result collector for use with Nagios.  It is designed to be a flexible data transport mechanism and processor, with a simple and powerful architecture that allows for it to be easily extended and customized to fit individual users' needs.

By default, NRDP has the capability of allowing remote agents, applications, and Nagios instances to submit commands and host and service check results to a Nagios server.  This allows Nagios administrators to use NRDP to configure distributed monitoring, passive checks, and remote control of their Nagios instance in a quick and efficient manner.  The capabilities for NRDP can be extended through the development of additional NRDP plugins.
